# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1”

### Event Objectives

* Provide practical insights into AWS Bedrock and modern AI development
* Introduce foundational model concepts and prompt engineering best practices
* Demonstrate RAG workflows and embedding-based search
* Present AWS AI services commonly used in real-world applications
* Explain AgentCore and production-ready GenAI system architecture

### Speakers

* **Lam Tuan Kiet** – Senior DevOps Engineer, FPT Software  
* **Dang Hoang Hieu Nghi** – AI Engineer, Reonova Cloud  
* **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** – Cloud Engineer Trainee, FCJ  
* **Kha** – Shared advice on building product-oriented projects for CVs  
* **FPT Representative** – Spoke on companies using AI on cloud for optimization and cost savings  

### Key Highlights

#### Foundation Models & Industry Direction

* Traditional ML models handle *one task* and require labeled data.
* Foundation models in Generative AI are trained on massive unlabeled datasets, enabling versatile multi-task capabilities.
* Bedrock now integrates models like **OpenAI** and **DeepSeek**.
* Companies increasingly build AI-driven products on cloud platforms to reduce operational cost.

#### Insights from Lam Tuan Kiet

* Explained the evolution from traditional ML → foundation models.
* Emphasized the importance of prompt engineering for high-quality outputs.
* Demonstrated how Bedrock simplifies access to advanced models without complex DevOps.
* Highlighted that building AI products requires skill, iteration, and responsible deployment.

#### Promp Engineering

* **Zero-shot prompting** – Minimal context; results may be simple or vague.  
* **Few-shot prompting** – Provide examples inside the prompt for clearer responses.  
* **Chain-of-thought prompting** – Guide the model with reasoning steps for improved accuracy and detail.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

* The system retrieves relevant information from a data source.
* It automatically combines user prompts with retrieved context.
* Produces more accurate and relevant responses.

#### Embeddings

* Text is converted into vectors representing meaning.  
* Similar meanings cluster together in vector space.  
* **AWS Titan Text Embeddings** support over 100 languages.

#### AWS AI Services

* **Rekognition** – Image/video object detection  
* **Translate** – Automatic translation  
* **Textract** – Extracts text and layout structures  
* **Transcribe** – Speech-to-text with speaker recognition  
* **Polly** – Text-to-speech  
* **Comprehend** – NLP, entity extraction, relationship understanding  
* **Kendra** – Intelligent document search  
* **Lookout Family** – Anomaly detection for metrics, equipment, and vision  
* **Personalize** – Recommendation systems  
* **Pipecat** – AI agent pipeline framework  

Developers can use these services directly via APIs.

#### Amazon Bedrock AgentCore

* Allows building AI applications without heavy DevOps and infrastructure management.
* Supports modern frameworks like **LangGraph** and **LangChain**.
* Designed to help teams move from prototype → production efficiently.

**Key Mechanisms**

* Runtime  
* Memory  
* Identity  
* Gateway  
* Code Interpreter  
* Browser Tool  
* Observability  

### Key Takeaways

#### AI Development Mindset

* Real-world product creation is more valuable than passing academic requirements.
* Foundation models allow rapid experimentation and deployment.
* Prompt engineering significantly affects output quality.

#### Technical Impact

* RAG enhances accuracy by grounding responses in real data.
* Embeddings improve semantic search and information retrieval.
* AWS AI services cover end-to-end workflows—from speech to vision to NLP.

#### Real-World Relevance

* Companies increasingly adopt cloud-based AI to reduce costs and accelerate product development.
* Skills in prompt engineering, embeddings, and Bedrock services are becoming essential.

### Event Experience
